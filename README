INSTALLATION:

This plugins needs mysql and the perl modules modules DBI, DBD::mysql and PHP::Serialization to be installed. You can probably install them from your operating system repository, otherwise you can use CPAN to install them.

In mysql you need to create a database and create an account with the proper privileges by issuing the commands on the mysql prompt:

> CREATE DATABASE events;
> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE ON events.* TO event_user IDENTIFIED BY 'secret_password';
> USE events;
> SOURCE mysql_tables.txt;

You should change the username and password for security reasons. You can do this by replacing 'event_user' and 'secret_password' with a username and password of your choice.  You can choose your own database name by replacing all occurrences of 'events' by your database name.

To install the plugin, you should copy the contents of the backend directory to your nfsen backend-plugin directory (see the $BACKEND_PLUGINDIR variable in nfsen.conf), and the contents of the frontend directory to your nfsen frontend-plugin directory (see the $FRONTEND_PLUGINDIR variable in nfsen.conf).

To configure the plugin, add the following lines to the %PluginConf section of nfsen.conf file:
events  => {
	db_connection_string    => "DBI:mysql:database=event;host=quadraplex;port=3306",
	db_user                 => "nfsen",
	db_passwd               => "nfsen",
}

To enable the plugin, add the following line to the @plugins list in your nfsen.conf file:
[ "live",  'Events' ],

KEEPING THE DATABASE CLEAN:

You can periodically clean up the database by using the 'delete_queries' variable:

%PluginConf = (
	delete_queries          => [
		{ # Delete events after 14 days (14 days*24 hour*60 minute*60 seconds=1209600 seconds)    
			"StopTime"=>['[le]#$unix_time-1209600#'],
		}
	...
	],
	...
