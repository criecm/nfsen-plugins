INSTALLATION:

This plugins needs the nfsen-events plugin to be installed. The files in the backend directory should be place in the nfsen backend plugin directory ($BACKEND_PLUGINDIR in nfsen.conf). The mail-templates directory can be placed at a location of your choise (for example: $VARDIR/mail-templates, where the value of $VARDIR is defined in your nfsen.conf).

CONFIGURATION:

To load the plugin, you should add this line to the @plugins section of nfsen.conf:
	[ "live",  'Events_mail' ],

To configure the plugin, you should add an "events_mail" section to the %PluginConf variable in nfsen.conf. This section should contain a "template_home" variable which points to the mail-templates directory, and a mails variable. The "mails" variable contains a list of mails that should be sent. For every mail you define the folowing variables:

query    : defines the condition for which the mail should be sent.
to       : the reciepient(s) of the mail
subject  : The subject off the mail
template : Which template to use
action   : can be used to change the event to make sure it isn't reported twice.

This is an example configuration which reports events from the botnet plugin:

events_mail => {
	template_home           => "$VARDIR/mail-templates",
	mails => [
		{       
			query => { # send a mail for suspected bots
				"Type"=>"[eq]botnet",
				"Level"=>"[eq]alarm",
				"Notified"=>"[null]",
			},
			to => ['person1@domain1.com','person2@domain2.com'],
			subject => '[Nfsen: botnet] source host: $event{Source} destination host: $event{Destination}',
			template => "botnet_iodef.tp",
			action => { # Make sure not to report it again before it times out
				"Type"=>"[eq]botnet",
				"Level"=>"[eq]alarm",
				"Notified"=>["[null]",'[set]#$unix_time#'],
				"UpdateTime"=>'[set]#$unix_time#',
			},
		},
	]
},
